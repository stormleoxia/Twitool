Lx is made up of many pieces of code, all of them open source, but
different pieces of Lx may use different licensing terms.

For comments, corrections and updates, please contact contact@leoxia.com

* Dual Licensing

	Lx is dual licensed, it is available to the
	public in Apache License form, but we also offer those pieces
	under commercial terms from Leoxia for the cases where the
	Apache License is not suitable.

	If you want to contribute to the project, you must sign an agreement 
	that allows Leoxia to redistribute the code under other licenses.

	If there is a demand for that, we may also release it under LApache License terms.
	
	For the actual license links in the Lx distribution see the
	bottom of this file.

	If you need further information, please contact contact@leoxia.com
